The pursuit of a higher education degree in business is now international. A survey shows that more and more Asians choose the Master of business administration (MBA) degree route to corporate success. As a result, the number of applicants for MBA courses at Asia-Pacific schools continues to increase. Across the region, thousands of Asians show an increasing willingness to temporarily shelve their careers and spend two years in pursuit of a theoretical business qualification. Courses in these schools are notoriously tough and include economics, banking, marketing, behavioral sciences, labor relations, decision-making, strategic thinking, business law, and more. The data set data.csv shows some of the characteristics of the leading Asia-Pacific business schools.

I have conducted analysis to address the following:
1. Include a summary (mean, median, standard deviation, variance, range, minimum and maximum) for each quantitative variable in the dataset. Use a table to display the summary measures of all the quantitative variables in one place. What insights do these descriptive statistics provide concerning Asia-Pacific business schools? 
2. Summarize the data to compare the following:
  a. Any difference between local and foreign tuition costs. (5 points)
  b. Any difference between mean starting salaries for schools requiring and not requiring work experience. 
  c. Any difference between mean starting salaries for schools requiring and not requiring English tests. 
3. Do starting salaries appear to be related to local tuition? Do starting salaries appear to be related to foreign tuition? Justify using visual and numerical measures. 
4. Draw a boxplot to graphically summarize the starting salaries data. Identify the first, second, and third quartiles from the boxplot. Are there any outliers?
